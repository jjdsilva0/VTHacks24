            Archosaur Dominance and Early Dinosaur Origins 
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-md mt-4 px-4">
            In the early and middle Triassic, the world was dominated by archosaurs, a group of reptiles that included 
            ancestors of crocodiles, pterosaurs, and dinosaurs. In the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic extinction, 
            archosaurs quickly diversified and adapted to new environments. The first true dinosaurs began to evolve from 
            small, bipedal archosaurs around 230 million years ago, during the late Triassic.

            The First Dinosaurs Emerge

            The earliest known dinosaurs, such as Herrerasaurus, Eoraptor, and Staurikosaurus, appeared in what is 
            now South America. These small, agile creatures were fast and bipedal, with early carnivorous species 
            leading the way. The appearance of these dinosaurs marks a key evolutionary moment, as they were among 
            the first to show traits that would define the group, such as upright posture and specialized teeth.

            Sauropodomorphs: Herbivores Evolve
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-md mt-4 px-4">
            At the same time as theropods, another group of dinosaurs called sauropodomorphs emerged. Plateosaurus, 
            one of the best-known sauropodomorphs from this period, was an herbivore that walked on two legs but 
            could also use all four. These early sauropodomorphs were relatively small compared to their later descendants, 
            but they began to experiment with large body sizes and long necks, trends that would define their lineage in the Jurassic.

            Dinosaur Competition with Other Reptiles

            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-md mt-4 px-4">
            In the Triassic, dinosaurs were not yet the dominant land animals. They faced stiff competition from 
            large predatory reptiles like rauisuchians (crocodile relatives) and herbivorous dicynodonts (therapsid reptiles). 
            These groups shared many ecosystems with early dinosaurs, and it was a time of evolutionary experimentation as 
            dinosaurs vied for survival and dominance against these larger, established species.

            Dinosaur Adaptability and Evolutionary Success 
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-md mt-4 px-4">
            As the late Triassic progressed, dinosaurs began to show greater adaptability than their reptilian competitors. 
            Their upright posture, efficient breathing systems, and bipedal locomotion gave them advantages in mobility and 
            endurance. These traits allowed dinosaurs to exploit new ecological niches, slowly increasing their 
            numbers and diversity.

            The Rise of Herbivorous Dinosaurs

            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-md mt-4 px-4">
            In parallel with the growth of carnivorous theropods, herbivorous dinosaurs also became more diverse. 
            Early sauropodomorphs, such as Massospondylus, began to dominate certain environments. Their long 
            necks allowed them to reach higher vegetation, giving them a competitive edge in resource-poor environments. 
            Over time, their size increased, further establishing their role in ecosystems.

            The End-Triassic Extinction
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-md mt-4 px-4">
            The Triassic ended with a massive extinction event, caused by volcanic eruptions 
            linked to the break-up of Pangaea and subsequent climate change. This event, known 
            as the Triassic-Jurassic extinction, wiped out many dominant groups, including rauisuchians 
            and many large therapsids. Dinosaurs, however, survived and capitalized on the extinction of 
            their competitors, becoming the dominant land animals in the Jurassic.

            Dinosaur Dominance After the Extinction

            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-md mt-4 px-4">
            With many of their competitors gone, dinosaurs quickly filled the vacant 
            ecological niches after the extinction. Both carnivorous theropods and herbivorous 
            sauropodomorphs diversified and spread across the supercontinent of Pangaea. The 
            Triassic-Jurassic transition marked the beginning of the Age of Dinosaurs, as they 
            rose to prominence and spread across the globe, setting the stage for their dominance in 
            the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
